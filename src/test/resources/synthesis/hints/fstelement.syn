should be able to retrieve first element with help of complete examples
the first element of a SLL
{r -> x sll(x)}
{r -> z sll(y)}
concretely,
{r -> 5 * [5 -> 3 *...] }
returns
{r -> 3 * [5 -> 3 *...] }
#######

{S1 =i {x} ++ S ; ret :-> x **  [x,1] ** x :-> v ** lsegs(v, 0, S)}
void fstelement(loc ret)
{true ;  ret :-> x ** lsegs(x, 0, S1)}

######
// ret points to the head of the SLL, hd points to the second element of the SLL (represented as lsegs)
void fstElement (loc ret, loc y) {
  let x = *ret; //  store value of hd at x
  let h = *x; // store value pointed to by hd
  free(x); // free hd
  *ret = h; // return value pointed to by hd (which is second element)
}
